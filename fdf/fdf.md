The goal is to create a simplified graphic "wireframe" representation
of a relief landscape, by linnking various points together.__

__The coordinates are stored in a file passed to the program.
the horizontal position of each value corresponds to its axis,
the vertical position corresponds to its ordinate and his value corresponds to its altitude.__

__This is the input given to produce the picture above.__
